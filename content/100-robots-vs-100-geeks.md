We’ve just about finished setting up the 100 robots gear at [BarCamp
Brighton 4][] in a derelict building that’s going to make the gig feel
like an illegal rave. If you’re at BarCamp please come downstairs to
hear us sing songs about the surveilance state, Twitter and the Iran
election, gene therapy cures for aids, world of Warcraft love affairs
and lots more at 8:15 this evening. If you can’t make it we’re also
playing at the Prince Albert on Trafalgar street in Brighton at 8
<span class="caps">PM</span> on the 24th of October and if you can’t
make it to either you can watch the videos from the Dance of the Dead
zombie prom which are now on YouTube. You can also listen to and
download some of our tracks for free from [last.fm][] or [myspace][] and
add yourself as a fan to the [facebook page][].
