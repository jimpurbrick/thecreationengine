One of the things I’ve been tinkering with since leaving [Linden Lab][]
is Creatarr: a creative, collaborative social game. Creatarr’s goal is
to bring some of the magical collaborative creation found in [Second
Life][] to a wider audience and to push creativity in social games and
the web beyond virtual farming and impact text on animal pictures.

I quickly got busy building the [<span class="caps">CREST</span>
<span class="caps">API</span>][] for [<span class="caps">CCP</span>][]
and I’m likely to have even less free time when I start [my new gig][],
but [Facebook][] are happy for me to continue to tinker with Creatarr
and I like shipping code, so I’ve decided to make Creatarr public and
run it for as long as people are playing. There are plenty of rough
edges, but there are also some [neat ideas][] and plenty of fun to be
had, so head over to [creatarr.com][] and dive in.

Thanks to [@mrkemeny][], [Irene Soler][], [Chris James][], [@yandle][]
and [@profaniti][] for helping to build Creatarr.
