One epic meta-game design I first remember talking about a decade ago
while working on [Warhammer Online][] is the multi-scale online game: a
system of interconnected games in which you choose to be a solo
operative, work in a small group, or command epic forces or huge space
fleets and influence a single universe however you choose to contribute.
It’s a recurring game design meme that I’ve talked about several times
since and I’m sure many others have had similar discussions around the
globe ever since multiple computers were connected together.

So, I’m super excited to see [<span class="caps">CCP</span> games][]
take a huge step towards realizing this epic game design dream today by
linking the internet spaceship game [<span class="caps">EVE</span>
online][] with the brand new <span class="caps">PS3</span> first person
shooter [Dust 514][]. Players piloting giant spacecraft in
<span class="caps">EVE</span> online will be able to swoop down from
space and interact with other players running around on the planet’s
surface playing Dust 514. This is very cool.

I’m also very excited that the two games are connected using the
[<span class="caps">CREST</span> <span class="caps">API</span>][] that I
helped to build: an <span class="caps">API</span> that will be usable
everywhere. Not only will you be able to interact with the
<span class="caps">EVE</span> universe at every scale from the human to
the intergalactic, the clients used to connect to the universe will work
on every scale of device from phones to desktops and every scale of
interaction from web tools built by 3rd parties, through 5 minute casual
experiences to epic space battles played out in full 3D over hours and
campaigns played out over years.

Today’s connection of <span class="caps">EVE</span> and Dust is a
historic moment, but it’s just the beginning of what will be a very
exciting second decade for the universe of New Eden.
