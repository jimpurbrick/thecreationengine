After [The Spirit of Gravity](https://spiritofgravity.com/) in February I ended up talking to [Jason Hotchkiss](https://hotchk155.blogspot.com/) and [Jo Summers](https://twitter.com/profaniti) in the Rossi Bar. I knew Jason from a [Build Brighton](https://buildbrighton.com/) guitar pedal workshop years ago and more recently as a sound artist from the [Sound Plotting](https://soundartbrighton.com/productions/sound-plotting/) event [Alien Alarms](https://alienalarms.bandcamp.com/) played at a year ago, but Jo knew Jason as a game developer who made [1D Pong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7CsDeUTwxM) which she had included in a [Pop Up Arcade](https://twitter.com/pressfiretowin) years ago. After talking about another [1D dungeon crawler](https://www.aipanic.com/projects/wobbler) we started thinking about the most ridiculous 1D game we could imagine in 2023 and settled on 1D, 1 button battle royale.

Normally that’s where the story would end, but for some reason the idea kept rattling around in my head and I ended up putting my thoughts down in a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17NDLoDa17drcMevKgGfAccfIcZB-v6BC2UhEinW_hpQ/edit?usp=sharing) and thinking about how to make it happen.

To be a [battle royale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game) the game had to be a multiplayer last-person-standing shooting game with players positioned on a shared map with the goal of eliminating the other players, but with a 1D display the challenge couldn’t come from aiming. Judging the distance to shoot by charging and launching a missile solved this problem and provided a fun core gameplay loop which could be implemented with a single button. Hold the button to charge the missile then release the button to fire a distance dependent on the time the button was depressed.

I haven’t made a game in a long time and I’ve never made a hardware game, so this project has been a lot of fun. It’s also something that I couldn’t have done without Jason, Jo and everyone at the Brighton Indie Gamedev socials: thank you to everyone for your help and feedback.
