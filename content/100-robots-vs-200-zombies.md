I may not have blogged much recently, but I’ve been hard at work writing
new songs about the financial meltdown, the surveilance state, gene
therapy cures for hiv, anger and guilt for the new band I’ve put
together with [Max Williams][] and [Aleks Krotoski][]: [100 Robots][].
We’ll be performing the new songs along with rock/dance/electronic
versions of Thriller and [Re: Your Brains][] among others to 200 zombies
at [Dance Of The Dead][]: a charity zombie prom in London in aid of St
Mungos on April 4th. If you’d like to come along, dance, rock, shamble
and groan tickets are available [here][]. I’m always happy to [dress][]
[up][] [as][] [a][] [zombie][], throw in playing music and supporting a
band called the [The Tits Of Death][] and it’s clear that this is going
to be the best gig ever!
