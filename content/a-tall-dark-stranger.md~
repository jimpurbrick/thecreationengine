Over the past few years I’ve spent a lot of time helping people new to
virtual worlds understand how they work. Over the next few weeks I’m going
to share a series of short posts on some of the high level concepts I
covered which will hopefully be useful to other people new to virtual
worlds. [The previous
post](https://jimpurbrick.com/2020/09/09/the-conversation-around-content/)
talked about ways in which you can fill an entire world with things to
keep everyone interested forever. This post talks about how you can
make sure everyone can create an avatar representation that allows them
to fully express themselves within a virtual world.

[Professor Richard
Bartle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bartle), the co-creator
of[ MUD1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD1) and networked multi-user
virtual worlds in 1977 is fond of saying that he prefers text-based
virtual worlds because the graphics are better. Just as a good book
can conjure vivid images in the mind, text can conjure images of
worlds which would be hard or impossible to render with
triangles. Another huge advantage of text-based worlds is that it is
far more common for people to author text than to create 3D art
assets. If I want to be a tall dark stranger in a text based world it
is as simple as setting my description to those words. If I want to be
a tall dark stranger in a VR environment it is much harder.

Where a virtual world has a clearly defined setting such as high
fantasy, space opera or tropical pirates it can be feasible to supply
a wide enough variety of faces, bodies, clothing, accessories and hair
styles. This is the approach taken successfully by[
EVE](https://www.eveonline.com/) or[ Rare](https://www.rare.co.uk/)
with the[ infinite pirate
generator](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php)
and results in a wide variety of avatars which are all thematically
consistent with the world. If you are building a Metaverse which
connects every possible virtual world how do you start? How do you
please the person who wants to have the perfect tall dark stranger
avatar rendered in 3D as well as everyone else?

This was the challenge facing[ Linden Lab](https://www.lindenlab.com/)
when building the avatars for[ Second Life](https://secondlife.com/)
at the turn of the millennium. While the default avatars could be
manipulated into a huge variety of shapes and sizes using the
available parameters, the results were often crude and the available
wardrobe never strayed far from geeky teen hangout chic. Luckily for
Linden Lab the inability of the avatar system to satisfy every whim
was a huge opportunity for the entrepreneurs of Second Life.

Builders quickly realized that they could fashion shoes, hair, clothes
and accessories from primitive 3D objects which could be attached to
avatars to dramatically increase the gamut of styles that could be
realised. Linden Lab enabled another wave of innovation by allowing
animations to be uploaded which as well as allowing every conceivable
dance move to fill the nightclubs of Second Life also enabled tiny
avatars which either folded up the default avatar geometry inside
cutely sculpted animal models or moved the default avatar under the
floor so it was completely hidden and just served as a platform for a
tiny replacement avatar standing on its head. Many years later Linden
Lab finally allowed people to entirely replace the default geometry
and textures so now it is common for not a single triangle or texel in
a Second Life avatar to have been defined by Linden Lab.

People were welcome to build their own clothes and avatars from
textures and geometry, but the vast majority instead chose to buy and
combine pieces from the vast array of builders who were paying their
real life rent by selling virtual goods and so were more than happy to
cater to their every desire. If you wanted to be a tall dark stranger
there were a huge number of them to choose from. If you wanted to
combine a punk jacket with a tutu to create a unique and look you
could do that without ever opening photoshop.

People chose to be robots, punks, steampunks, wizards, astronauts and
chose looks from across every conceivable genre of art, fiction and
real life fashion scene. Conversations about where people found
clothes or accessories became common, people went shopping for clothes
together, attended and hosted fashion shows or reported on them in
social media, just like in real life. Avatars and fashion became
important [content around which conversation would
form](https://jimpurbrick.com/2020/09/09/the-conversation-around-content/).

Second Life in general accepted this riot of self expression with open
arms. IBMers attended a company all hands talk by their CEO in Second
Life as aliens in suits among a variety of other things. While a few
areas enforced dress codes or handed out attire which would match the
theme of their experience, most of the time this was optional. Avatars
were seen as a very personal form of expression which people building
experiences would respect and not constrain. Some people would revel
in this freedom by changing between avatars and identities frequently
and on a whim, but in general the more well known someone became in
Second Life, the more useful having an immediately recognizable avatar
became, the less frequently they would tend to change their avatar and
the more onerous being asked to change their appearance in order to
fit in with an experience became.

We should bear these lessons in mind as we think about avatars for the
virtual worlds of the future. While default avatar styles should be
comfortable for a wide audience of people and acceptable for
developers building a wide range of experiences, we likely also need
to allow people to easily create everything from clothes and virtual
personal electronics to blend shapes and eye movement simulation
models and the services to allow people to buy, sell and police
virtual goods and take them wherever they go across the
Metaverse. Ultimately the developers of a successful Metaverse
shouldn’t need to define avatar styles: the virtual fashion industry
they enable will.
