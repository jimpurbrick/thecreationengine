Last week I gave a lab talk to my former research colleagues at the [Mixed Reality Lab](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/mixedrealitylab/) at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) about the work I've been doing since leaving the lab over 20 years ago. Rather than talk about technology I focussed on the lessons that todays efforts to build the Metaverse can learn from virtual worlds of the past and the lessons that the real world might be able to learn from virtual worlds of the future.

I'd like to thank my former PhD supervisor [Professor Chris Greenhalgh](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/people/chris.greenhalgh), [Professor Steve Benford](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/people/steve.benford) and everyone else at the MRL for a great discussion and for making me feel very welcome.
