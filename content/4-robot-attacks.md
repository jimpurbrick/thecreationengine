Incredibly, 100 robots have 4 gigs lined up in the next 3 weeks:
tomorrow we’re playing at an electro/rock night at [The Freebutt][] with
[Bang Bang Eche][], [Son of Robot][] and [labasheeda][], then next
Thursday we’re playing at a more hip hop themed night at [The Hope][]
with [Tactical Thinking][] and [L-Mo][]. On the 2nd of December we’re
playing at the music hack themed [£5 App Christmas Special][], where
I’ll also be giving a talk about my open source guitar mounted iPhone
multitouch Mrmr/LiveAPI/<span class="caps">OSC</span> wireless Ableton
Live interface and then using it to play live. Finally on the 11th of
December we’re playing at the Linden Lab Brighton Christmas party along
with the other real rock band that formed from the remnants of the all
conquering Linden Lab Brighton virtual Rock Band.

Whew. It’s going to be a busy few weeks. If you can come to any of the
gigs, please do. It’s going to be fun: we’ll be playing brand new songs
including our first excursion in to Rock/Dubstep and trying out new ways
of performing. If all the gigs weren’t in Brighton I’d call it a tour…
