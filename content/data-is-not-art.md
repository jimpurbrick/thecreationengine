This week I experienced two remarkable combinations of music and the
moving image.

[Natures 3B][] from [Quayola][] on [Vimeo][].

This evening I watched [Nature][] — Mira Calix and Quayola’s audio
visual piece which took video footage of flowers blowing in the wind and
used motion tracking technology to generate music from the footage. As a
concept it was interesting, unfortunately as music it was terrible. The
beauty of the footage betrayed the folly of the concept: if a human were
to compose music based on the beauty of flowers the way they moved in
the breeze might feature, but wouldn’t be the basis of the entirety of
the piece. The colour, form and memories triggered by the flowers would
surely feature. Turning the flowers to a network of points modulating
parameters reduced them to an interesting if psuedo-random system and
the resultant synthesised music was predictably cold and pseudo random.

By contrast, a few days ago I had the pleasure to watch [Manhatta][], a
black and white movie about Manhatten made in 1920 by Charles Sheeler
and Paul Strand and accompanied by a new soundtrack by the Cinematic
Orchestra. Where Nature used machines to generate it’s soundtrack based
on an algorithmic interpretation of the movement of flowers, Manhatta
uses humans to generate it’s soundtrack based on the emotional impact of
the moving image on the musicians. The result is infinitely more moving.
The music adds emotion to the moving image, combining feelings of
wonder, awe, fragility and insignificance — a uniquely human reaction to
the images of the worlds most amazing city that cannot possibly be
understood or rendered by an algorithm, no matter how clever.

Art is a human reaction to our world, not something that can be captured
in an algorithm.
