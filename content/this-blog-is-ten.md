Just over ten years ago I set up [The Creation Engine
No. 2](http://jimpurbrick.com/2008/07/01/hello-world/) after
previously blogging on the original [Linden Lab](http://lindenlab.com)
hosted [Creation Engine](http://secondlife.blogs.com/babbage/) and
before that on [Terra
Nova](http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/08/terra_nova_welc.html). So, while I've been blogging for almost 14 years, 10 years of The
Creation Engine No. 2 seems like a good excuse to look back at the
last decade of blogging.

Behind the scenes the technology behind The Creation Engine No. 2 has
changed a lot. Originally hosted as a
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) site on
[Byteflow](https://bitbucket.org/piranha/byteflow/wiki/Home), I
converted the blog to a static site generated by
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and hosted by
[github](https://github.com/) almost exactly 5 years ago. I wrote a post at
the time detailing the move, which I finally [published on its 5th
birthday](http://jimpurbrick.com/2013/07/02/pelican-powered/) after
rediscovering it today. Despite the big changes behind the scenes,
[github's support for custom
domains](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)
and [Pelican's support for RSS
import](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/importer.html) meant that
the only externally visible changes to The Creation Engine No. 2 were
cosmetic. All the RSS feeds and links to the site were unaffected,
which is great because [Cool URIs don't
change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI).

While the technology has changed a lot, the content continues to
mostly be a [hack diary](https://www.hackdiary.com/) describing the
various contributions I've made to projects like the [EVE CREST
API](http://jimpurbrick.com/2016/01/03/crestmatic/),
[nailgun](http://martiansoftware.com/nailgun/),
[buck](http://jimpurbrick.com/2014/08/18/buckd/),
[infer](http://jimpurbrick.com/2015/06/11/free-tests-for-everyone/)
and
[ReactVR](http://jimpurbrick.com/2018/05/22/replicated-redux-movie/). I
write these posts as documentation in case I have to solve similar
problems in future, but it's also great when they're useful to others,
so I'm very happy to see that my recent set of posts about using
[ReactVR with
Redux](http://jimpurbrick.com/2018/05/22/replicated-redux-movie/) have
been my most popular posts to date.

I don't attend as many conferences now as I did while I was working at
[Linden Lab](https://www.lindenlab.com/), but the various conference
write up posts serve a similar purpose: reminding me about the talks
and speakers I've seen and hopefully also pointing others to useful
information. Social media is now more effective for letting people
know about future events, so I rarely use The Creation Engine to
announce upcoming events, but still think its a useful place to
collect longform thoughts about past events and links to recordings.

One post which doesn't fit in to the above catatories is my [review of
Now We Are 40](http://jimpurbrick.com/2017/04/20/2-2-decades/) and
thoughts on growing up with the web. Part of the reason I posted it here
is because I could. I don't need someone to speak for me or my
generation, I can do it myself. I'm very grateful that I've been able
to share my thoughts with the world for the last decade and very happy
that a lot of people have found them useful.

Happy birthday to The Creation Engine No. 2. Here's to the next 10.
