Lots of exciting [100 robots][] news! Our debut album, Attack!, has been
professionally mastered by Chris at [Melograf Mastering][] who has done
an amazing job and made the album sound incredible. The new version is
already available at [bandcamp][] and will be available on itunes,
[amazon][] and many other download services on Monday. To celebrate the
launch we’re playing live at The Hope in Brighton [tomorrow night][] and
have set up a [new blog][100 robots] where we’ll be giving away a track
from the album free every month and I’ll be doing most of my 100 robots
related music blogging from now on. Head on over and subscribe to the
feed so you don’t miss out. Hope to see you at [The Hope][] tomorrow!
