I’ve just been at a really interesting [cafe scientifique][] in Brighton
where [Philip ‘Critical Mass’ Ball][] talked about using physics to
model the behavior of people en mass. When modeling people as particles
you can create surprisingly realistic simulations of real behavior in
corridors, traffic jams and panics. As fascinating as this is, I only
think this I’d useful on situations where there is little historical
evidence to rely on and where the cost of change is high. In the case of
parks it is much better to ship a park in beta without any paths and
then close the park in November to pave the cow paths than it is to
model the park up front and hope that your model bears some resemblance
to reality. Physics has invented models of reality just as reality has
invented methods of measurement that don’t require modeling. [Jeremy
Keith][] is Philip Ball’s nemesis, whatever he may say.
