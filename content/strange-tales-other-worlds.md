At the end of last year, [Michael Brunton
Spall](www.brunton-spall.co.uk) and [Jon
Topper](https://twitter.com/jtopper ) asked me if I would like to give
the opening keynote at [Scale Summit](http://scalesummit.org) as I had
"lots of experience scaling weird things", by which they meant Second
Life and EVE Online. I immediately thought of The Cornfield, a place
in Second Life modelled after an episode of The Twilight Zone where
naughty avatars were sent to think about what they had done. Several
more bizarre anecdotes quickly came to mind and soon I had a talk:
Strange Tales From Other Worlds. A few people who couldn't make it to
Scale Summit mentioned that they wanted to hear the talk, but the
recording I made at Scale Summit was somewhat disapointing. Luckily I
was invited to give the talk again a few weeks ago to the Oculus team
at Facebook London and made a Keynote recording which I've now
uploaded to YouTube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAh-6nEHwqI). The strange tales
are mostly true, but a few errors snuck in to the second telling:
firstly MUD stands for Multi User Dungeon and secondly I forgot to
credit Brian Boss√© for his amazing work on TiDi the second time
around.
