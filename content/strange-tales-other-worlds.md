At the end of last year, [Michael
Brunton-Spall](www.brunton-spall.co.uk) and [Jon
Topper](https://twitter.com/jtopper ) asked me if I would like to give
the opening keynote at [Scale Summit](http://scalesummit.org) as I had
"lots of experience scaling weird things", by which they meant Second
Life and EVE Online. I immediately thought of [The Corn
Field](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/The_Corn_Field), a place in
Second Life that is a reference to an [episode of The Twilight
Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Good_Life_(The_Twilight_Zone))
where naughty avatars were sent to think about what they had
done. Several more bizarre anecdotes quickly came to mind and soon I
had a talk: Strange Tales From Other Worlds. A few people who couldn't
make it to Scale Summit mentioned that they wanted to hear the talk,
but the recording I made at Scale Summit was somewhat
disapointing. Luckily I was invited to give the talk again a few weeks
ago to the Oculus team at Facebook London and made a Keynote recording
which I've now uploaded to YouTube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAh-6nEHwqI). The strange tales
are mostly true, but a few errors snuck in to the second telling:
firstly MUD stands for [Multi-User
Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD1) and secondly I forgot to
credit [Brian Boss√©](https://twitter.com/Riot_Penrif) for his amazing
work on
[TiDi](https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/introducing-time-dilation-tidi/)
the second time around.
