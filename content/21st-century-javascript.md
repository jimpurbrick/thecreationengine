The [slides][] and [video][] of my talk at [AsyncJS][] on Thursday are
now online. The video is pretty murky, but the sound has come out fine
and you can see enough of the slides to be able to follow along at home.
The talk focuses on ways to bring useful software engineering patterns
to JavaScript, patterns that will be increasingly important as
JavaScript applications become larger and more complex.

Thanks to [Prem][] for inviting me to talk and to everyone who came
along to the [Async][] session for the fascinating discussion.
