The recording of my recent [Stereopsia 2020 talk about the art of designing social VR experiences is now online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMxuJC1JBSY). The talk summarises a lot of material covered in more depth in my posts on [The Conversation Around Content](https://jimpurbrick.com/2020/09/09/the-conversation-around-content/), [A Tall Dark Stranger](https://jimpurbrick.com/2020/09/16/a-tall-dark-stranger/) and [Small Places Loosely Joined](https://jimpurbrick.com/2020/09/23/small-places-loosely-joined/), so if please read those posts if you would like to learn more.

The current situation made it impossible to host the normal Stereopsia conference, but also created the opportunity for a conference on immersive technologies to be held in a multi-user immersive experience for the first time and also made it possible for me to take part. I'd like to thank Ricard Gras for inviting me to talk and for everyone at Stereopsia for making me feel very welcome.
