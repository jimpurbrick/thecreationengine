Last year I hosted a panel on [creating a safe environment for people
in VR](https://youtu.be/JEWHaDt-qiE) with [Tony
Sheng](https://twitter.com/tonysheng) and [Darshan
Shankar](https://twitter.com/DShankar) at OC3. I [commented at the
time](http://jimpurbrick.com/2016/10/31/creating-a-safe-environment-for-people-in-vr/)
that the discussion reminded me of the story of
[LambdaMOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LambdaMOO) becoming a
self-governing community told by [Julian
Dibbell](http://juliandibbell.com/) in [My Tiny
Life](http://www.lulu.com/shop/julian-dibbell/my-tiny-life-crime-and-passion-in-a-virtual-world/ebook/product-17492539.html),
so I was very happy to have the opportunity to compare the established
and novel approaches to Building Safety in to Social VR at
[OC4](https://www.oculusconnect.com/) with [Mike
Howard](https://twitter.com/ross_beaf).

While technology changes, people stay the same, so it's important that
we don't lose the lessons learned by people like Julian, [Richard
Bartle](http://www.youhaventlived.com/qblog/), [Raph
Koster](http://www.raphkoster.com/), [Damion
Schubert](http://www.zenofdesign.com/) and the many others who have
been wrestling with and thinking about these problems for decades.
