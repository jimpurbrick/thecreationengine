One of the events that kicked off [Brighton Digital Festival][] was
[dConstruct][], the always thought provoking conference run by
[clearleft][].

</p>

As usual I found most of the sessions interesting, but not always
relevant as there’s a heavy design rather than development focus. The
most relevant talk this year was Kevin Slavin’s final talk, [Reality is
Plenty][], which argued that augmented reality is not the next big
thing, just as it wasn’t in 2005.

</p>

Despite Kevin having a dig at [Second Life][] and having spent a lot of
time working on Augmented Reality with [Blast Theory][] while at
Nottingham University, I mostly agreed. While there are definitely use
cases which benefit from augmented reality (fighter pilot navigation
systems and things like Carbon Goggles which are all about making
invisible aspects of objects visible) and virtual reality (simulation
and virtual meeting spaces) there are plenty of others which are better
served by other interfaces. Environments like Second Life are
particularly exciting as they allow people to quickly prototype systems
to discover which applications work and which don’t.

</p>

With both <span class="caps">AR</span> and <span class="caps">VR</span>
it’s tempting to argue that they allow for intuitive interfaces as they
model or overlay the real world: people know how to navigate a 3D space
so they know how to use a 3D environment and they know how to use
<span class="caps">AR</span> as they can see. Anyone who has done their
time climbing the Second Life learning curve or trying to use
<span class="caps">AR</span> to find their way around will know this
clearly isn’t true. Apparently more abstract interfaces like maps, which
talk to the mind rather than the senses are often much easier to use.

</p>

There’s a lot of work to be done to make both
<span class="caps">AR</span> and <span class="caps">VR</span> as easy to
use as 2D interfaces, let alone as natural as using real world senses.
Now that the huge technical problems around networking virtual
environments and tracking real world objects with mobile devices are
starting to be solved, it is mostly <span class="caps">UI</span> work
that needs to be done to make these technologies more widely used.

</p>

Even if the <span class="caps">UX</span> issues are solved there will
still be many cases where speaking to the mind is much better than
speaking to the senses.
