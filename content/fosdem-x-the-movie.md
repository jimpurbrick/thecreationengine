A video of my <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> talk about Mono in Second
Life and our plans for the future of scripting is now online (the slides
are also available [here][] ):

Watching back, I was surprised to hear myself say “Hooray!”, “Shit” and
“Crap” quite so often…

While you’re catching up on <span class="caps">FOSDEM</span> talks, I
recommend [Miguel][], [Jeremie][] and [Alan][]‘s talks from the Mono
track. Unfortunately it doesn’t look like the very interesting talks on
the <span class="caps">XMPP</span> track are available online, but I’m
going to be catching up on [lots of the talks I missed out on][],
including the key note talks on Saturday morning which I missed due to
the very enjoyable beer event on Friday evening…
