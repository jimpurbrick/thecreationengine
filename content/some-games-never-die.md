While goofing around asking <span class="caps">UK</span> indie game
developers for their top 5 games of all time at [World of Love][], I was
very pleased to hear that the amazing <span class="caps">ZX</span>
spectrum strategy game [Chaos][] featured in multiple lists.

</p>

I love Chaos so much that I developed Law, a Chaos remake at university
as a way to learn Java. It turns out that a bunch of other people love
Chaos too: a year or so ago one of the administrators of the Chaos
Remakes Wiki got in touch with me to say that he’d been able to pull a
copy of my original web site from an archive and wondered if I still had
a copy of the game itself. The reminiscing at World of Love was enough
for me to finally wade through decade old backups looking for a copy of
Law and I’m happy to say that I found a copy and that it still runs on
modern Java runtimes.

</p>

If you remember the original Chaos, head over to the [Chaos Remakes
Wiki][] and indulge in some retro gaming nostalgia. If you’d like to
tinker with it (please fix the yellow text on grey dialogs and add
<span class="caps">AI</span> wizards!) the code is available under the
<span class="caps">GPL</span> license from [BitBucket][].
