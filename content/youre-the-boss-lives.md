Back in 2005, while I was working on [Second Life][] in Nottingham,
before [Linden Lab Brighton][] existed, I ran a workshop as part of the
Screenplay “Boss Frenzy!” day at the Radiator Festival which allowed
children to collaboratively create a computer game by drawing or making
bosses with collage.

</p>

Dozens of people came to the Broadway in Nottingham and got busy with
pens, pencils, paper, scissors, glue and magazines to design bosses for
our “You’re The Boss!” shmup. We had an amazing time and created a
charming and delightful game which I talked about on the original
[Second Life blog][].

</p>

I immediately thought of it when we started planning the [Brighton Maker
Faire][] a couple of months ago and was delighted when the project was
accepted. Unfortunately 6 years of bit rot had taken it’s toll and
disaster loomed after discovering that I’d hosted the [Game Maker][]
files on the web space provided by an old <span class="caps">ISP</span>
account and didn’t have them on my patchy backups. Luckily the ever
amazing [Torley][] had a copy of the executable and with the help of a
[decompiler][] I was able to recover the Game Maker files I needed to
run the project again.

</p>

So, if you’re near Brighton on the 3rd of September and like the idea of
collaboratively making an arcade game with scissors, glue and pens then
please come along. If you have a Windows machine then check out the game
we made in Nottingham in 2005. I think it’s still charming and
delightful 6 years on. You can download it [here][].

</p>

This time round I’d like to make the game completely out of [Creative
Commons][] licensed works, so please suggest
<span class="caps">CC</span> licensed books, comics and pictures that
might make good source material in the comments, or bring them along on
the day.
