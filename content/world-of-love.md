Thanks to a tip off from [David Hayward][], I managed to snag a last
minute ticket for the [World Of Love][] independent games conference
organized by [Pixel Lab][], sponsored by [Preloaded][] and hosted by
[Channel 4][]. I’m glad I did.

</p>

The day kicked off with [Chris Delay][] from introversion demonstrating
[Subversion][], a typically minimal game inspired by Mission Impossible
(the <span class="caps">TV</span> show, not the movies). It ticked a
huge number of boxes for me as a game, but the most interesting thing
about the demo is that the game is nowhere near finished and it’s not
often you get to see a game this early in production. I suggested to
Chris that the game should feature Sporty Spy, Posh Spy, Ginger Spy and
Scary Spy. Look out for those in the final version.

</p>

Possibly the most inspiring session of the day was [Terry Cavanagh’s][]
talk on game jams. Setting the scene with a description of his stalled
over ambitious uber project, Terry the rattled off an amazing list of
games he made at game jams like [Sinewave Ninja][] which ultimately
morphed in to the amazing [v six times][]. I’ve had a ton of fun
building [mashups][] at [Hack Days][] so I can imagine adding games to
the mix would be amazing. I predict game jams will be coming to Brighton
in the very near future…

</p>

Definitely the most amazing talk of the day was by [Eskil Steenberg][]
who was delighted to be talking at the first conference dedicated to his
game, Love. After a brief tour around a beautiful procedurally generated
and fully dynamic world, Eskil showed off the amazing tools that have
allowed him to build an on line game on his own. A suite of networked
art tools allowed him to model then procedurally
<span class="caps">UV</span> map and texture a 3D model and then
demonstrate how altering the model would result in updated
<span class="caps">UV</span> maps and procedural textures in real time.
It was like being given a tour of the future and when Eskil ran out of
time I fully expected him to pull out a time machine to allow him to
keep going.

</p>

The rest of the day included lots of really useful advice for indie game
development including talks on business, finance, law and marketing
which ended with the [Frozen Synapse][] developers bursting in to blast
the attendees with water pistols to demonstrate [Kieron Gillen’s][] last
marketing rule — you’re creative, so be creative with marketing.

</p>

Overall I prefer the many tracks and everyone gets involved format of
[GameCamp][] and at times the talks devolved in to extended biographies,
but mostly it was a fun, thought provoking and inspiring day. I spent
the evening asking the attendees for their top 5 games (it felt like it
was that kind of event) and was very pleased to hear [Chaos][] featured
in multiple lists (it’s one of my favourites too, I developed a
[remake][] at university. On the strength of the
<span class="caps">UK</span> indie scene demonstrated at World of Love
I’m sure we’ll be seeing more indie games in top 5 lists in the
near future.
