100 robots first album, “Attack!” is now finished and available to
download now from [bandcamp][]. I’m so glad that it is done and very
proud of the result. It’s the first album I’ve made [since 2005][] and
the first I’ve produced using [Ableton Live][], which once again proved
to be an amazing piece of software. The ability to quickly cycle through
libraries of samples to find the right sound, easy parameter automation
and super flexible routing using drum racks were a huge help.

It’s also the first time I’ve tried to put together a big rock/dance
production at home which made mastering tricky as we wanted both a big
loud rock sound and huge slabs of sub bass. Because the of the huge sub
bass, the [Fletcher-Munson][] effect meant that while the
<span class="caps">RMS</span> loudness of our initial mixes were normal,
the [a-weighted][] <span class="caps">RMS</span> values were very low,
making the mixes sound very quiet when burned
to <span class="caps">CD</span>.

The mixes couldn’t simply be turned up without clipping or compressing
the mixes which would introduce distortion or reduce the dynamic range
of the music. Not wanting to get sucked in to the [loudness war][] we
ended up in a complicated 3 way trade off between a-weighted
<span class="caps">RMS</span>, sub bass weight and dynamic range.
[Audioleak][] and the [Pleasurize Music][] tools were both really
helpful during this process. We ended up with an an album that hit the
[sweet spot][] of -14 dBFS A-weighted <span class="caps">RMS</span>, has
an average dynamic range of <span class="caps">DR6</span> (admittedly
less than the recommended <span class="caps">DR10</span>) and hopefully
still has enough sub bass to work on a big system. A couple of people
have commented that it sounds over-compressed, but most people seem to
like where we ended up.

I hope you enjoy the album and that you can join us at the launch
parties at the [Hydrant in Brighton][] on the 31st of May or at the
[Maze in Nottingham on the 14th June][] — they’re going to be
great nights!
