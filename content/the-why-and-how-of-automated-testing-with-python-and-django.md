Jamie has just uploaded the [movie][] of my talk “The Why and How of
Automated Testing with Python and Django” which I gave at [BrightonPy][]
a week ago (and this time it really is a movie, clocking in at a feature
length 1 hr and 35 minutes). The audio on the video is fine (and
arguably the laptop-eye-view video is improved by chopping my head off
for large parts of the talk), but it’s tricky to see the slides on the
video, so I’ve uploaded them to [slideshare][].

The talk rambles a bit in places and there are a couple of things that
betray my static language roots for example you can’t actually use unit
tests to discover dependencies as easily in python as you can in C++.
I’m also already evolving the <span class="caps">JS</span> testing stack
I talk about here: moving from [qunit][], [qmock][] and [Selenium][] to
[jsmockito][] and possibly [JsTestDriver][]. Overall I think it’s a
pretty good overview of how an agile software engineering process can be
screwed together.

Many thanks to [@garethr][] for donating his [Fabric][] scripts, Spike
for his database migration cameo, [Si][] for recommending [Hudson][],
[Dave][] for hooking me on automated testing and [j4mie][] for
organising the night and wrangling the video. If you’d like me to help
your organisation improve its agile engineering process, please [get in
touch][].
