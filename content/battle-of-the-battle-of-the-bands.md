Somehow, [100 robots][] have ended up playing 2 different Battle of the
Band competitions on consecutive nights in Brighton: at [The Providence
on April 2nd][] and [The Lectern on April 3rd][].

So, which band is the best and which battle of the bands is better?
Early indications favour The Providence, which seems to have a better
<span class="caps">PA</span>, but The Lecturn is near the University. It
could go either way.

Anything you can do, I can do meta: join us for both nights of the
Battle of the Bands tour and see who we declare the winner of the Battle
of the Battle of the Bands!
