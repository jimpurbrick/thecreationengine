The recording of my recent [React Europe talk about Replicated Redux
is now online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr3vp0C22H0) and I've
written several other posts describing [
designing](https://jimpurbrick.com/2017/07/04/react-vr-redux-revisited/),
[testing](https://jimpurbrick.com/2017/07/31/testing-replicated-redux/)
and
[generalising](https://jimpurbrick.com/2017/11/10/replaying-replicated-redux/)
the library if you would like to know more about the details. If you’d
like to play the web version of pairs or see the rest of the code,
it’s available on github
[here](https://github.com/facebook/react-360/tree/master/Examples/Pairs).

People often describe multi-user networked VR experiences as laggy,
but code to hide latency by optimisticly predicting the effects of
local actions is hard to write, difficult to test and often
application specific. It feels great to have helped make this
problem a little easier to solve for React developers by building Replicated
Redux.
